## Lessons learned :

React router has some high limitations when using to pass information and is not always the best choice for changing
display.
Instead of using react router for returning information after the first call to get the class name, spell name, monster
name and so on,
I learned how to use bootstrap to create a collapse button to return another component and return prop information.
This project provided a lot of practices with mapping objects and different substructures within a Json object. 
## Challenges :

1. issue with react-router url coming from API as starting / in it, which is creating issues when trying to use router
   to pass information
