# Description : 
Thought there are many possible option here I am limiting drop down to four for this phase of the project.
The manin Goal here is to make the return more searchable and user-friendly and to be able to access that second layer of 
information returned inside the "url" portion of the return object from the api call.



## Goals :

| Steps                                                         | Issue | Status |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|-------|--------|
| Change search to dropdown                                     |       |        |
| display multiple name at once for return                      |       |
| make name return click able to pull up additional information |       |
